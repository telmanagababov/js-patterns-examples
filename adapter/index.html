Playing in a Bingo room allows them to play against other players or they can enjoy it at online casinos where they will play a single player kind of bingo where there are no other players involved.</p><p>The online casino game that is based on luck and probability and is enjoyed by millions of bingo players around the world.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><center><img src="http://cdn.onlinecasinobluebook.com/images/bingo.jpg" alt="Bingo Balls" title="Bingo Balls"></center><br> &nbsp;<p></p><p>The main concept of the game is the bingo card. Players will purchase one card or a number of cards when they enter the bingo hall or online casino. A caller will call numbers and players will mark these numbers on their cards. Players who achieve specific winning patterns will earn payouts. There are 2 different types of Bingo, 90-Ball Bingo and 75-Ball Bingo; however, you will find a number of creative versions of bingo games available online.</p><p><a name="bingo-history"></a><br> &nbsp;</p><h1>Bingo History</h1><p>The history of the game goes back to 1530 in Italy with a lottery called “Lo Giuoco Del Lotto D’Italia.” The lottery is still being played to this day and takes place every Saturday. The game migrated to other parts of Europe and it reached France in the 1770s. Le Lotto, as it was called, was a game that was enjoyed by the high class and the rich French aristocrats. By 1880, the game reached Germany but in that country it was not a recreational game but an educational one used to help children study spelling, math and history.</p><p>Bingo first came to the United States in 1929 under the name of Beano. The game was played for the very first time in Atlanta, Georgia during a carnival. In the United States, when a player achieved a winning pattern he would yell “BEANO” in order to get the attention of the caller and other players to declare that he has won. This is actually the reason behind the modern name of the game Bingo: Edwin S. Lowe invented the bingo cards that we know today. He overheard someone yell Beano, but he heard it as Bingo, and this is where the name of the game came from.</p><p>Edwin Lowe was a salesman who sold toys and he thought that he could capitalize on the game’s popularity. He hired Carl Leffler a professor of mathematics at Colombia University to help him increase the number of combinations available on the bingo cards. Leffler succeeded greatly and he came up with more than 6,000 different combinations of cards. Lowe was then approached by a priest who asked him if they could use bingo cards to raise funds for the church. He agreed, which resulted in a spike in the popularity the game. In 1934, more than 10,000 bingo games took place every single week. Today it is estimated Americans spend more than 90 million dollars per week on bingo.</p><p>The original bingo cards had 27 squared spaces that came in the form of a 9 x 3 grid with 9 columns and 3 rows. Each row had 5 squares that contained numbers while the remaining 4 squares were empty. Each vertical column contained up to three numbers. The first columns included numbers that varied between 1-9, the second column’s number varied between 10-19, the third column’s numbers varied between 20-29 and so on. Of course, there are other forms of bingo cards that can be found, especially online, but this format remains to this day.</p><p><a name="how-to-play-bingo"></a><br> &nbsp;</p><h1>How to Play Bingo</h1><p>There are two versions of Bingo: land-based bingo where players go to actual bingo halls and online bingo that is played on the Internet. Since both are slightly different, we are going to discuss the gaming procedure of each separately.</p><p><strong>For Land Based Bingo:</strong></p><p>Players must buy tickets in order to participate in the game. Players will also have to pay an admission fee. After they buy the tickets, they will enter the hall and grab a seat at the tables with other players. Right before the beginning of the game, the Caller (the person who calls the numbers) will announce the rewards the game will offer.</p><p>After doing that, the caller will say “eyes down,” which signals the beginning of the game. The caller will then start to call numbers. These numbers are either drawn from a bingo tumbler that has the bingo balls or they can be generated by a Random Number Generator (RNG). Players will hear the numbers that are called and they will mark them using a red marker on their cards. The caller can call the numbers simply as they are such as forty-two, thirty-two or he can use a repetition format for some number such as “both the fives, fifty-five” or “Five and Two, Fifty Two”. Also the numbers that end with a 0 have a special calling as they are referred to as Blind, for example if he draws a 40 he will say “Four-o Blind, Forty”.</p><p>Players who achieve any of the winning patterns will have to yell “Bingo” to grab the attention of the caller and the other players. The venue will send people over to check the authenticity of the win before players can be paid. The game can end or it can continue depending on the rules of the venue, as well as the kind of pattern the winning player achieved.</p><p><strong>For Online Bingo:</strong></p><p>Online bingo is another story. It is quicker, simpler and can be played at any time without having to leave the comfort of the home. However, it does not offer players the same social experience as bingo halls since there is no human contact. This is why many people still prefer land-based bingo halls.</p><p>The procedure of online bingo is easy. Players will choose a bingo room, choose a number of cards and will join other players in the room. Players can chat with each other during the game play. A caller will call numbers similar to land-based bingo. When a number is called, players will mark the numbers. Once they get a winning pattern, they will click on a button to announce it. Of course, the rules and the patterns are quite different than land-based bingo and even the cards have a different format. These cards are usually squared and they have a 5×5 grid filled with 25 numbers.</p><p><a name="bingo-rules"></a><br> &nbsp;</p><h1>Bingo Rules</h1><p>While different bingo venues and halls have different rules, the same general guidelines are applied everywhere. We are going to discuss the general rules:</p><p>Bingo players who achieve a winning pattern on any of their cards have to yell “BINGO” in order to grab the attention of the caller and the other players.</p><li>Any individual who is sitting in the bingo hall has to be involved in the game; any persons who are not participating in the game will not be permitted inside of the hall. The audience is not allowed into the halls.</li><p></p><li> Players who would like to repeat the numbers that the caller calls can do it quietly in their head but they are not permitted to repeat them out loud. This can disturb other players and causes them to lose their concentration.</li><p></p><li> The players are not permitted to address the caller except to ask him to call the numbers louder or slower. Some players who might be on a losing streak tend to scream at the caller and ask for the caller to be changed, but this is not acceptable at all.</li><p></p><li> Players are not permitted to leave the hall unless the game is over. If they leave while the game is still in play, they will not be allowed to re-enter.</li><p></p><li> Players will yell “bingo” when they form a winning pattern; there are different patterns that players can achieve.These patterns are:</li><p> –  A Line Pattern is when bingo players mark off all five numbers that exist on any horizontal line on the bingo ticket.<br> –  Two Lines is when players mark off five numbers on two of the horizontal lines on one of their bingo cards.<br> –  Full House is the biggest win and has the highest payout. It is when players mark off all of the numbers on one of their Bingo cards.</p><p>Most bingo venues, especially in the UK, start the bingo game with a line game. When someone achieves a line, they start a two-line game and then end with a full house game. Some other venues might only play a full house game directly. In the UK’s National Bingo Game, they do not play 1 line or 2 line, but they do play Full House.</p><p>The rules of online bingo are much simpler as there is no bingo hall, so players can call out numbers loudly, they can sit and watch or do whatever they want. The only rules they are interested in are the winning patterns and payouts. Players will be able to view these rules at each game as every game has its own rules and payouts. Players should check the rules of each game before they start playing to know what they are getting themselves into.</p><p><a name="bingo-odds"></a><br> &nbsp;</p><h1>Bingo Odds</h1><p>Like any other game that involves numbers, there is always a technique and a counting system involved- in this case a number counting system. Counting in bingo resembles card counting in blackjack, but in a game of bingo you are counting the bingo balls’ numbers instead of Blackjack cards. In order to master such techniques, it is vital to have knowledge about the mathematical probability of the game.</p><p>Usually, a game of bingo is played with 75 balls. So the mathematical probability of any number being drawn is 1 in 75, the second number will be 1 in 74 and so on. This means the random factor has something called “uniform distribution.” There is an equal number of even numbers and odd numbers called as well as an equal number of low and high numbers. If you stay in the bingo game long enough, eventually you will win and the numbers in your card will be called. Bingo theorists have concluded that winning at bingo is related to how long can you stay in the game rather than blowing a lot of money on bingo cards in a single play.</p><p><strong>The Tippett Theory:</strong></p><p>Another strategy was developed by L. H. C. Tippett based on the randomness complex theory. This theory states the more bingo numbers that are called, the higher the chance the numbers are going to be close to 38, the median number. According to the theory, if you are playing a short bingo game and can select the card you will play with, you should choose cards that are closer to 1 and seventy-eight. On the other hand, if you are playing a longer game, you should choose cards that are closer to thirty-eight. You can tell if a bingo game is going to be a long or a short game by checking the patterns chosen. For example Four Corners, U or S patterns take a longer time than simple diagonal lines.</p><p>All of that being said, it has to be noted Bingo is a game of luck rather than a game of odds. No matter what happens, the numbers are random. But there are some things that can be done to increase the odds. For example, choose games that have a smaller number of people: if there are one-hundred players in a bingo room and each one has 4 cards, each player has a 1 in 100 chance of winning. Of course, doing this has its advantages and its disadvantages because bingo venues usually determine the jackpot according to the number of players. A game that has a low number of players will have a low jackpot as well. You have to decide what is more important; having a bigger win or increasing our odds of winning a smaller payout.</p><p><a name="bingo-strategy"></a><br> &nbsp;</p><h1>Bingo Strategy</h1><p>Bingo is a pure game of luck because the numbers are randomly drawn whether manually or through an RNG. The game doesn’t have enough complexity to qualify as a game where players can beat the house. Most gambling experts view Bingo as a game of chance and believe there are no techniques or strategies that would guarantee a win. Despite that, there are some tips that can help you slightly increase your chance of winnings:</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><center><img src="http://cdn.onlinecasinobluebook.com/images/bingo.strategy.jpg" alt="Bingo Strategy" title="Bingo Strategy"></center><br> &nbsp;<p></p><p><strong>The Number of Cards:</strong></p><p>One of the most common strategies of bingo players is playing with as many cards possible to increase the chance of winning. If you have more cards, there is a bigger chance the caller will call your number. Some experts say four cards is the best number but this can change according to the number of other players and the jackpot amount of the game.</p><p>Also, some venues will not allow players to play with a lot of cards and some even obligate players to have the same amount of cards, like Bingo games that take place in churches.</p><p><strong>Choose a Number of Cards that you can watch:</strong></p><p>Although you should play with as many cards as you can, it does not mean you should buy so many you can’t follow and watch them all. Buying a lot of cards but being unable to mark off the numbers or follow them is pointless and is a waste of time and money.</p><p><strong>The Variety of Numbers:</strong></p><p>Another important aspect is not only the number of cards but the variety of the numbers on these cards. When players plan to purchase more than one card, they should view the cards and choose those that do not have a lot of common numbers so they can increase their chances of winning.</p><p><strong>The Number of Players Involved:</strong></p><p>Join bingo games that have a low number of players as this increases your chance of winning. Avoiding event days and special games is advisable. Although this increases your chances, it also increases the chances of other players.</p><p><strong>Attention and Concentration:</strong></p><p>Players should listen carefully to the caller and must make sure that they are marking off the correct numbers.</p><p><strong>Always Choose the Auto-Daub Mode:</strong></p><p>Auto-Daub is present in online bingo. With this feature, the game marks off the numbers that are called automatically. This can be very helpful when you are playing with a large number of bingo cards as they can be a little hard to follow.<br> &nbsp;</p><div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"><div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon sd-sharing"><h3 class="sd-title">Share this:</h3><div class="sd-content"><ul><li class="share-facebook"><a rel="nofollow" data-shared="sharing-facebook-2938" class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon no-text" href="https://www.onlinecasinobluebook.com/education/tutorials/bingo/?share=facebook&amp;nb=1" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Facebook"><span></span><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-twitter"><a rel="nofollow" data-shared="sharing-twitter-2938" class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon no-text" href="https://www.onlinecasinobluebook.com/education/tutorials/bingo/?share=twitter&amp;nb=1" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Twitter"><span></span><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-pinterest"><a rel="nofollow" data-shared="sharing-pinterest-2938" class="share-pinterest sd-button share-icon no-text" href="https://www.onlinecasinobluebook.com/education/tutorials/bingo/?share=pinterest&amp;nb=1" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Pinterest"><span></span><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-google-plus-1"><a rel="nofollow" data-shared="sharing-google-2938" class="share-google-plus-1 sd-button share-icon no-text" href="https://www.onlinecasinobluebook.com/education/tutorials/bingo/?share=google-plus-1&amp;nb=1" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Google+"><span></span><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-reddit"><a rel="nofollow" data-shared="" class="share-reddit sd-button share-icon no-text" href="https://www.onlinecasinobluebook.com/education/tutorials/bingo/?share=reddit&amp;nb=1" target="_blank" title="Click to share on Reddit"><span></span><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-linkedin"><a rel="nofollow" data-shared="sharing-linkedin-2938" class="share-linkedin sd-button share-icon no-text" href="https://www.onlinecasinobluebook.com/education/tutorials/bingo/?share=linkedin&amp;nb=1" target="_blank" title="Click to share on LinkedIn"><span></span><span class="sharing-screen-reader-text">Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)</span></a></li><li class="share-end"></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="clear"></div><div class="clear"></div>
